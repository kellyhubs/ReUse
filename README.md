# ReUse
ReUse was developed and designed for the purpose of spreading awareness for sustainability. Users can post thier thoughts and ideas to keep other users accountable for keeping Earth healthy and happy!

Developed a social media web application using the MERN stack, with the integration of jsonwebtoken middleware to ensure secure management of users' authentication and authorization. Users have the ability to share personal posts and photos, react to them with likes or dislikes, but only their own posts can be deleted.

## Ideas and future work 
- A comment section in posts for users to communicate with each other 
- A event, market, and home page for organization 
- Buddy/ friend system 
- Better design and usability
